                       Have you ever heard of ‘love at first taste’? That was exactly what I felt the first day I got a taste of stir -fry spaghetti. Right there in my small office space, I was literally transported into a whole new universe filled with an abundance of  mouth-watering goodness.

I know we all eat pasta and by pasta, I mean good old-fashioned spaghetti, like it practically makes up pretty much 50% of our meals with different variations like macaroni, bucatini, penne, among others. We also have the jollof, fried or plain options, but the stir-fried method comes out top and the stir-fry chicken mixed with beef variant is my absolute fave. (You can call me a hopeless foodie, I don't really mind).

To ensure that I am not the only one who gets to relish this delicious love of mine, I have decided to share the recipe with you as well as a short video all from Sisi Yemmi

                       <li> Use a frying pan most preferably a non-stick frying pan, heat up 2 tbs of vegetable oil. </li>
<li>Add onion, ginger and garlic, and stir fry on high heat for about 2 minutes.</li> 
<li>Add half a seasoning cube, curry and thyme.</li> 
<li>Next, add the green, red and maybe yellow  peppers and stir fry for 2 minutes.</li> 
<li> While stir frying, on another hob, place a pot of water, add one salt and a few drops of vegetable oil and allow to boil while you are busy with the stir fry.</li>
<li>P.s: Also, you can wait till you are done stir-frying before putting your pot of water for the spaghetti on the hob (in that way you can do all the things you need to do one step at a time).
Transfer the vegetables (pepper) to a plate, and in that same pan add the stir fry chicken, it is important that the chicken doesn’t have droplets of water (you can sieve it for a while). </li>
<li>Go back to the pot of boiling water and add your spaghetti to start cooking.</li>
